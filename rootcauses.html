    Food insecurity is  more often than not the result of relining and segrigation in amarica.The steady increase of the living cost in california is aslo a key factor in understanding why food insecurity is so rampent in the USA.There are two calssifications of food insecurity, Low food security and very low food security. Low food security is defined by lower quality ingredents or foods and very low is accociated with skipping meals or habeng very restrictive meals.

    Food droughts and desesrts are caused by a lack of healthy food within a certan area.Oakland is full of these food deserts because of the lack of care put into certan low income neiborhoods by the city.While there may have been some locations such as community foods that have tried to mitigate this issue it is still a rampit problem in oakland.More effort and care needs to be put into the placement of these healthy grocery stores to help benifit all bay area residents no matter theyre financial state.
